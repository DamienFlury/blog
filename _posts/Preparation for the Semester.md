# The idea
<!---->
<!-- A semester abroad. What an adventure! Our university -->
<!-- provides an excellent environment for us students to take -->
<!-- this chance and supports us so well throughout this challenge. They -->
<!-- nominate the students, help them with planning and organisation -->
<!-- and are always available, it's hard to describe how thankful I am -->
<!-- that this works so well. -->
<!---->
<!-- About a year ago, the thought of going to a semester abroad first -->
<!-- came to my mind. It's an amazing opportunity to see a country I've -->
<!-- never been to, find myself in a completely different culture with -->
<!-- a foreign language. After careful consideration I decided that -->
<!-- I wanted to go as far away as possible. So, Asia came to my mind and -->
<!-- I quickly had my eye on Tokyo, Japan. I asked the company that I work -->
<!-- in if it would be a possibility and my leaders all supported me with -->
<!-- that decision. I decided to apply for unpaid leave during that time. -->
<!-- My plan was to first go to Korea for a week or two at the  -->
<!-- end of July and then travel further towards Japan. However, this can be quite a -->
<!-- challenge with the student visa and therefore I decided to play it safe and -->
<!-- start traveling once I definitely receive the visa, as recommended by the -->
<!-- school in Japan. -->
<!---->
<!-- # Organisation of the visa -->
<!-- I got the message from my school, that I get my Certificate -->
<!-- of Eligibility (COE) rather late (~middle of August). That's just -->
<!-- the way the university does it and it doesn't seem like they -->
<!-- can make an exception. I talked to the Japanese embassy -->
<!-- , to discuss what my choices were, and the friendly woman -->
<!-- at the phone informed me that I could actually apply for the -->
<!-- student visa in South Korea. Or in any other place for that matter, -->
<!-- but as I planned to go to Korea beforehand anyway, this seemed perfect. -->
<!-- I also talked to the Japanese embassy in South Korea, but in the end changed my -->
<!-- plans as described before. -->
