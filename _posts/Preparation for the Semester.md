# The idea

A semester abroad. What an adventure! Our university
provides an excellent environment for us students to take
this chance and supports us so well throughout this challenge. They
nominate the students, help them with planning and organisation
and are always available, it's hard to describe how thankful I am
that this works so well.

About a year ago, the thought of going to a semester abroad first
came to my mind. It's an amazing opportunity to see a country I've
never been to, find myself in a completely different culture with
a foreign language. After careful consideration I decided that
I wanted to go as far away as possible. So, Asia came to my mind and
I quickly had my eye on Tokyo, Japan. I asked the company that I work
in if it would be a possibility and my leaders all supported me with
that decision. I decided to apply for unpaid leave during that time.
The current plan is to first go to Korea for a week or two at the 
end of July and then travel further towards Japan. As you will
read later, this can be quite a challenge with the student visa.

# Organisation of the visa
I just got the message from my school, that I get my Certificate
of Eligibility (COE) rather late (~middle of August). That's just
the way the university does it and it doesn't seem like they
can make an exception. I talked to the Japanese embassy
today, to discuss what my choices are, and the friendly lady
at the phone informed me that I can actually apply for the
student visa in South Korea! Or in any other place for that matter,
but as I planned to go to Korea beforehand anyway, this seems perfect
(if it works). I will ask the Japanese embassy of South Korea
next to make sure this really works and to organize an appointment.
